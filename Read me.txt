This 21 Flags game is taken  from a reality show, Survivor where contestants are taken 
to a deserted island to compete in a series of challenges. Contestants are tested on
their physical, mental and strategic thinking ability during the games and the last 
person standing wins the prize of $1 million.

21 Flags games pit two groups against each other. Each group takes turns against other 
removing flags. Participants can removed 1,2 or 3 flags at a time but no more than 3. 
The group that take out the last flag loses. 

This is a very interesting game and can seem quite complex to find a winning strategy 
at the first glance. However, the solution is quite straightforward if you try to see 
the game through mathematical lenses. Based on mathematical analysis, I created a bot
that is scalable (i.e adaptive to changes in starting number of flags and maximum number
of flags allowed to remove) that would give serious competition to human rivals.
